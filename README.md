```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Credits
- Enrique Del Castillo Ch√°vez
- I only have my first project which I included as project 1.
-  The second project are mountains in Turkey. The third one is the black forest in Germany. The fourth one is a website to himalayas.
- I give all rights to the people that created the websites this hmk has links for.

## Tests
- Image links work
- Menu links work
- I was not able to make my "about-me" text description shrink when it goes further than 650 pixels. Sorry! It would be awsome to know how to do it, since I did not had enough time with my teachers to walkthrough it completely.
